# CHANGELOG

## v0.0.4 - 2011-11-07

  * Catch yet more connection errors

## v0.0.3 - 2011-10-21

  * Catch more connection errors and recover
  
## v0.0.2 - 2011-10-01
                
  * Don't crash out on connection errors -- sleep for (10 * interval) 
    and then try again. Servers go down, shit happens, etc. There's no 
    need for `imaprelay` to die as well.

  * Better logging

  * More robust connection closing and exception handling

## v0.0.1 - 2011-09-31

  * Initial release
